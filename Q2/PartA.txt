Q: What software patters are in use when using...

A: Stream architecture uses the Decorator pattern as it gives a way of providing 
different forms of behavior through a single base type. It means you can then attempt the base
type based on your usecase. e.g. your base type of Stream could have MemoryStream, FileStream,
GZIPStream etc. They have a good foundation underneath that is built upon easily.
